# Implementing Code Enhancement Pipeline with Azure OpenAI

## Step 1: Set Up Azure OpenAI Service

1. **Create an Azure Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up for an Azure account.
2. **Create an Azure OpenAI Service**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Create a new resource and search for "Azure OpenAI Service".
   - Follow the prompts to set up the service.

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

You'll need to install the Azure and OpenAI SDKs. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install openai azure-identity azure-mgmt-openai
```

## Step 3: Authentication and Setup

You'll need to authenticate with Azure and set up the OpenAI client.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.openai import OpenAIManagementClient

# Set your Azure subscription ID
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'

# Authenticate with Azure
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create OpenAI management client
openai_client = OpenAIManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Retrieve the OpenAI endpoint and API key
openai_endpoint = 'your-openai-endpoint'
openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
```

## Step 4: Create the Code Enhancement Pipeline

Now, we'll create the code enhancement pipeline. The pipeline will:
1. Take a code snippet as input.
2. Send it to the OpenAI model for enhancement.
3. Return the enhanced code.

```python
import openai

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai.api_key = openai_api_key

def enhance_code(code_snippet):
    # Define the prompt
    prompt = f"Enhance the following code:\n\n{code_snippet}"

    # Call the OpenAI API
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # or any other appropriate model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,  # Adjust as needed
        temperature=0.7
    )

    # Extract the enhanced code from the response
    enhanced_code = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return enhanced_code

# Example usage
code_snippet =
